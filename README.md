## Advance API Features

A number of the samples support the 'Advance API Features' Card Designer functionality. Samples that support the Advance API Features are clearly marked in the README files. 

This functionality allows dashboard editors to call the Microsoft Graph and SharePoint REST APIs without actual code.
