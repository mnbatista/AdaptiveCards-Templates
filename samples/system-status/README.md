# System Status

## Summary

Simple card that leverages the Advance API Features functionality of the Card Designer to display the status of IT Systems. It uses a SharePoint as the backend and each list item represents a separate system.

IT Admins would be responsible for maintaining the list and updating statuses and/or a process would be implemented to update them automatically.

The quick view displays the name of the system, the status and a list of any known issues.

The card template demonstrates how to use if statements in adaptive cards for conditional formatting.
