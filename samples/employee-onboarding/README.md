# Employee Onboarding

## Summary

Simple card designed for employee onboarding. The idea is to audience target the card at a specific group which new joiners would be added to.

There are 3 steps and 4 useful links defined in the JSON for you to customize/add your own.

The Data JSON option has been leveraged to enable users without advanced knowledge of JSON to easily add onboarding activies and links to the card.

Users can simply update the data JSON to change the display.
